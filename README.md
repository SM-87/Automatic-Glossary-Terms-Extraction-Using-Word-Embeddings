# Automatic-Glossary-Terms-Extraction-Using-Word-Embeddings
This repository contains the extracted glossary terms set and ground truth set considering only the features and benefits attributes of the CrowdRE requirement specifications dataset. The original CrowdRE dataset is devloped by P. K. Murukannaiah et al. and can be accessed from "The smarthome crowd requirements dataset", https://crowdre.github.io/murukannaiah-smarthome-requirements-dataset/ , April, 2017. The file "Similarity Scores.pdf" reports the calculated cosine similarity scores in alphabetical order for the glossary terms (noun phrases) that are included in the final glossary set using our approach.
